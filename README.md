✨ Features

Window Management System: Fully draggable, resizable, and minimizable windows with dynamic z-index (active window stays on top).

Interactive Taskbar & Start Menu: Quick access to system "apps," settings, and social links.

File Explorer: A structured way to browse my projects, including my Netflix Clone and Secure Login Form.

Terminal Interface: A command-line themed "About Me" section for a true developer aesthetic.

Desktop Icons: Clickable shortcuts for Resume, Projects, and Contact info.

Responsive Design: Optimized for a desktop-class experience in the browser using modern CSS.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Custom Properties)

Logic: JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners for Drag/Drop)

Building this project pushed me to think beyond static layouts. Key takeaways include:

State Management: Handling which window is "active" or "minimized" without a heavy framework.

UI/UX Logic: Recreating the familiar "desktop" feel requires precise attention to drag-and-drop mechanics and z-index layers.

Clean Code: Organizing multiple "apps" within one page while keeping the CSS maintainable.
